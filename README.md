> I used this repo in order to make everything works <a href="https://github.com/nicolaserny/react-library-vite-example">https://github.com/nicolaserny/react-library-vite-example</a>

## Install

```bash
cd /packages && npm i
```

Build the library:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the development server of the test project:

```bash
 npm run dev
```

If you want to run the demo project if you want to create docs for you library, use the following commands:

```bash
 npm i
```

and then

```bash
 npm run dev
```

to run the dev server
